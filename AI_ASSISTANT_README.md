# AI Career Assistant Integration

This document describes the ChatGPT integration added to the Alumni Connect platform.

## Overview

The AI Career Assistant is a new feature that provides intelligent career guidance to alumni, students, and other users of the platform. It uses OpenAI's GPT model to offer personalized advice on:

- Career development and planning
- Networking strategies
- Professional development
- Mentorship preparation
- Job search guidance
- Skill development recommendations

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Intelligent Career Guidance
- Context-aware responses focused on career and professional development
- Conversation memory to maintain context across multiple questions
- Professional and encouraging tone appropriate for alumni networking

### ðŸ’¬ Chat Interface
- Clean, intuitive chat interface with distinct user and AI message styling
- Real-time responses with loading indicators
- Conversation history maintained during the session
- Mobile-responsive design

### ðŸ”§ Demo Mode
- Works out-of-the-box with intelligent mock responses
- Graceful handling when OpenAI API key is not configured
- Clear indication when demo mode is active

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- OpenAI API account (optional for demo mode)

### Configuration

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install openai
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   
   If you don't have an OpenAI API key, the system will automatically use demo mode.

3. **Frontend Setup**
   No additional setup required - the AI Assistant component is automatically included.

## Usage

1. **Access the AI Assistant**
   - Navigate to the "AI Assistant" link in the main navigation
   - Available to all users (no login required)

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Type career-related questions in the chat input
   - Press Enter or click Send to submit
   - The AI will respond with relevant career guidance

3. **Example Questions**
   - "How can I improve my networking skills as a recent graduate?"
   - "What skills should I focus on for a tech career?"
   - "How do I prepare for a mentorship conversation?"
   - "What are the best strategies for job searching?"

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

- **`controllers/aiController.js`** - Main AI interaction logic
- **`routes/aiRoutes.js`** - API endpoint routing
- **`/api/ai/chat`** - POST endpoint for chat interactions

### Frontend Components

- **`components/AIAssistant.js`** - Main chat interface component
- **Navigation integration** - Added to main navigation bar
- **Route configuration** - Added to App.js routing

### API Endpoints

```
POST /api/ai/chat
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "User's question",
  "conversationHistory": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Previous question"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Previous response"}
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "AI assistant response",
  "conversationHistory": [...],
  "demo": false
}
```

## Security and Privacy

- No user data is stored permanently
- Conversation history is maintained only during the session
- OpenAI API calls are made server-side to protect API keys
- System prompts guide the AI to stay focused on career-related topics

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback to demo mode when OpenAI is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages for API failures
- Automatic retry suggestions for temporary issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **User Authentication Integration**
   - Personalized responses based on user profile
   - Conversation history persistence

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Integration with alumni mentorship matching
   - Career assessment tools
   - Resource recommendations

3. **Analytics**
   - Popular question tracking
   - Usage metrics and insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI not responding**
   - Check if OpenAI API key is configured correctly
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Demo mode should work regardless of API configuration

2. **Demo mode always active**
   - Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in environment variables
   - Restart the backend server after adding the API key

3. **404 errors on AI endpoint**
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check that aiRoutes are properly imported in server.js
